---------------
Defines the RL problem for SkillPath AI: state representation, the action
space (which topic + difficulty to recommend next), and the reward signal.
This replaces the hand-written if/else "adaptDifficulty" logic in the old
agentUtils.js with an actual Markov Decision Process that the DQNAgent
learns to act in.

STATE  (12-dim vector):
    [mastery_0 .. mastery_7]   -- current mastery (0-1) for each of the 8 topics
    [recent_0, recent_1, recent_2]  -- last 3 quiz scores (0-1), oldest first
    [fatigue]                  -- session fatigue signal (0-1)

ACTION (24 discrete actions):
    action = topic_index * len(DIFFICULTIES) + difficulty_index
    i.e. "recommend this topic, at this difficulty, next"

REWARD:
    Combines quiz/code performance, mastery gained, how well the
    recommended topic matched what the learner needed, and a fatigue
    penalty -- same shape as the product's original design intent, but
    now the thing that decided the action is the network being trained
    on this reward, not a hardcoded threshold.
