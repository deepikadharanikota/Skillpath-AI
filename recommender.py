recommender.py
---------------
Replaces `my-app/src/utils/apiUtils.js`. The old JS file's job was to call
an LLM from the browser and ask it to *pretend* to be a DQN ("Return ONLY
valid JSON: {topic, difficulty, ...}"), with a hardcoded fallback used
whenever that call failed (which, running client-side with no API key,
it always did in practice).

This module removes the LLM role-play entirely. The actual trained
DQNAgent (dqn_agent.py) — a real neural network with real backpropagation,
epsilon-greedy exploration, and experience replay — makes every
topic/difficulty decision. This file just:

  1. Builds the state vector for the agent (via environment.build_state)
  2. Asks the agent to act
  3. Wraps the agent's decision in a friendly, templated explanation for
     the learner, in the same spirit as the old prompt's requested output
     shape (topic, difficulty, strategy, explanation, encouragement)

No network calls, no external LLM dependency required to run the app.
