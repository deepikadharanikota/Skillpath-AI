## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Approach

SkillPath AI models personalized learning as a **reinforcement learning problem**.

The system considers:

* **State:** Current learner knowledge and performance
* **Action:** Selection of the next learning activity/topic
* **Reward:** Improvement in learner performance
* **Next State:** Updated learner knowledge after completing the activity

The DQN agent learns a policy that attempts to select learning activities that maximize the learner's long-term improvement.
